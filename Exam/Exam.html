                  <p>Exotic animals are those that are not native or indigenous to the owner's area, while a pet is an animal that lives with people as a friend. However, many people also refer to native species when they use this word (e.g., snakes may sometimes be considered exotic as pets even in places where they are found in the wild).</p>   
                  <h3>What are the most common exotic animals vs pets?</h3>
                    <p>Honey bears, sugar gliders, corn snakes, green iguanas, black panthers, rosy boas, flying squirrels, bearded dragons, veiled chameleons, spotted pythons, leopard geckos, even poison dart frogs and pot-bellied pigs-these are just some of the exotic animals people sell as pets. More common house pets are dogs, cats, fish, birds, hamsters and rabbits.</p>
